# IBM_Watson_Assistant

I have built a simple chatbot with IBM Watson assistant that answers questions about the page I integrate the chatbot with (Robot Arm Control Panel).
Also, it suggests resources to help the user builds a chatbot with IBM Watson assistant and more. 
I used some Intents already exist like asking about the chatbot capabilities and ending the conversation and the other I added it.
